# What is Rund?

Rund is a deployment tool designed for solo developers and small teams seeking a simple solution to automate code deployments. Rund listens for incoming webhooks from services such as GitHub, GitLab, and others, deploying your code while allowing you to configure custom deployment scripts, thereby eliminating the complexities of manual deployment processes.
